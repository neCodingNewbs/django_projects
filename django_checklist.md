#Learning Django To Do List

##Why this list?

There are many excellent introductions to Django on the web. Many of them will have
you set up and run a simple Django web app in an hour. However, if you are
completely new to programming and web development, you may find it difficult
to understand what's going on. Most tutorials implicitly presume familiarity
with the basics of web development and programming. This list is my perspective
on what you need to really make sense of Django.

At minimum, I recommend learning some Python first if you are a coding newbie.
I also think it makes sense to know some HTML & CSS as they're not that difficult
and they'll help you setup your views (webpages).

If you have the time and motivation, I recommend going through everything in the
list and THEN moving on to Django tutorials. The tutorials will STILL be challenging,
but your brain will be freed up to focus on the higher level Django framework,
and be less overwhelmed by the confusing plethora of opaque code.

###1) HTML/CSS

  Learn at least the basics from a course like **Codecademy**:

   (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

  These tutorials  http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/

  are great and will have you building webpages in no time. (Actually, time
  will be equal to 2n + 1 % b).

###2) Python

  Django is the built in Python, so being comfortable with Python is crucial.
  If you're an experienced programmer, you might be able to jump straight into
  Django and figure out what's going on. Otherwise, learning Python first will
  make the Django code much clearer as you'll know what statements like
  *import*, *class*, *def*, etc, are doing.

  Start here: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python

  or here: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

  *Do both if you like!*

###3) Regex

  Regex stands for 'Regular Expressions' and are basically used to search
  for specific character patterns. Whatever type of programming you do,
  you'll need to be comfortable with regexes. Each language implements them
  slightly differently, but once you've got the basic idea from here:

  http://regexone.com/

  making sense of Django regexes should be easier.


###4) HTTP requests

  Again, know the basics. Read this : http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#whatis

  and this: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-headers-for-dummies--net-8039

  This may be tough reading, try to get an overview of the different types
  of requests (GET, POST, etc.), what 'client' and 'server' mean
  and the different error messages at minimum.

  Django does a lot of the HTTP work for you, but it helps to know what's
  going on under the hood.


###5) SQL & Databases

  Django uses the MVT framework, where M means 'models'. Models mean databases.
  The basic ideas of CRUD are straightforward, relational database theory is
  a bit more complicated. Luckily, writing SQL queries gets easier.

  Get ready. Work through the resources here:

   http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/databases

   Then, here:

   http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/databases-and-sql

   Ignore any references to Ruby.


###6) Javascript

  Javascript is the language of the web and you'll see it again and again.

  Work through Codecademy's course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
  at least to the end of 'Data Structures'.

  The aim at the moment is to get comfortable with Javascript syntax, you can
  work on improving your knowledge of Javascript as time goes on.


###7) jQuery

  jQuery is a Javascript library much used on the web and you'll need it to make
  your webapp responsive.

  Work through these resources to get a working knowledge of jQuery:

  http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/jquery-basics

###7) Command Line Basics

  Django development is run from the command line (terminal window), so you'll
  need to be comfortable with simple commands. At the very least, you need
  to know how to navigate the directory structure.

  Go here: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ and do at least half of it
  ('Moving a File').

###8) Git

  This isn't part of Django per se, but you'll need a way to safely store your
  project using 'source control'

  To learn some Git Basics go here:

      https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git
      
  You should be able to **add, commit, push, and pull** by the end.
